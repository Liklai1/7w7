       <p class="text-muted text-left">Sr. Cleofe, Sr. Agnes Kurkalang, Sr. Cecilia Doyle and Sr. Mary Mascarenhas started a primary school in Imphal at a small house called "Nirmalabas". Soon a nearby land belonging to R.K. Mangessana the royal family, was bought for the school and was blessed by the late Bishop Oreste Marengo. For construction sisters from Nirmalabas would walk all the way to the site with a tiffin box, and they would remain whole day to supervise the work. The big boulders were brought from Churachandpur in the truck belonging to the Salesian fathers. Some of the funds were provided by the Congregation but to raise more funds sisters used to stitch uniforms for the students. In 1962 construction work was completed and students were transferred to the new buildings. There were 247 students and 10 boarders. School was recognized as a High School by L. Ch. Singh, Inspector of Schools, Government of Manipur on 1 November 1961. On 19 January 1966 School was recognized by the Board of Secondary Education Assam .</p>
